            Asking For a Friend is a learning tool. It gives a voice to students who would prefer to express their curiosity without speaking up.  Sometimes the best questions go unasked, and Asking For a Friend can help make sure that happens less often.

            Why it works:

          <Typography sx={{fontSize: '20px'}}>  
              Asking For a Friend anonymizes studentsâ€™ questions and encourages their peers to answer those questions. The benefits are threefold: introverted pupils get to have input into the conversation more often, students are subjected to each others lines of inquiry, and it protects students who might feel an otherwise good question would garner them mockery.

            Students can enter a question, which is then reviewed by the teacher. Once all submitted questions are reviewed for relevance to the topic at hand, the teacher submits the remaining questions (anonymously) to the whole class.  Students are then allowed to pick any question and answer it to the class.  Alternatively the teacher can answer on the students behalf if no students are willing to speak up.
